# Filmology
An application that shows the popular movies at the current time.

#To Compile and Run

To compile the program and run it you must obtain API through here --> https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api
and once you obtain the API key you can place it into the recommended location of the app's build.gradle file. **_WARNING_**: Not the module build.gradle file. Leave the single quote ' followed by the double quotes " otherwise you will obtain weird errors. So it should look like '"Your api key here"'.

#TODO

1. Finish up the detail activity UI, the detail activity class, and the detail activity fragment.
2. Create a settings activity and class which hold user preferences.
3. Allow the user to specify what resolution they would like the image and to allow the user to save the image into their device.

#Bugs

1) The app seems to load the same page twice then begins to behave normally, I will fix this bug as soon as possible.
